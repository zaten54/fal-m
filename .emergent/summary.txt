The previous AI engineer successfully launched MysticLens (later renamed fal覺m) as a full-stack web application for fortune-telling, transitioning from zero to a functional MVP. Initial efforts focused on core feature implementation (Coffee, Tarot, Palm, Astrology readings) and backend integration, including a switch from OpenAI to Gemini. A significant UI overhaul to an Apple-inspired design was underway and largely completed for the web app, alongside the integration of a JWT-based email-verified authentication system via SendGrid, and a user agreement clause.

The most recent phase pivoted sharply to Apple Vision Pro development. Recognizing platform limitations, the AI engineer shifted from direct native app development to providing detailed Swift/SwiftUI code templates and step-by-step Xcode setup instructions. The current work involves guiding the user through this manual Xcode project creation, including troubleshooting build errors by simplifying dependencies like ARKit for initial success, and verifying each setup step with the user.

The user envisioned 'MysticLens' (now 'fal覺m'), an innovative spatial computing fortune-telling application for Apple Vision Pro, leveraging AI for dynamic interpretations. Core functionalities include: AI-analyzed Coffee Fortune Reading from photos, AI-identified Palm Reading lines on virtual hands, a virtual Tarot Card three-card spread with interpretations, and Astrology Reading generating a personalized 3D birth chart and horoscopes. General requirements emphasized a minimalist, privacy-first, intuitive UX/UI aligned with Vision Pro paradigms (eye-tracking, hand gestures), and subtle ambient sound. Initial UI was futuristic with 5-language support. A subsequent explicit request mandated a complete UI redesign to Apple's iconic design language: abundant whitespace, clean layouts, premium typography, high-quality imagery, subtle gradients, and smooth transitions. All core fortune-telling features are implemented, and the Apple-inspired UI redesign was largely applied to the web app, alongside a user membership system with email verification and a legal terms of service agreement. The latest major request is to develop a native visionOS application.

API messages were updated for fal覺m branding.
*   ****: Stores backend environment variables.
    *   **Importance**: Critical for configuration, including , , and , .
    *   **Changes**:  replaced by .  and  added for email verification.
*   ****: Lists Python dependencies.
    *   **Changes**:  and  were added for authentication and email services.
*   ****: Main React component.
    *   **Importance**: Handles routing, global context providers (, ), and integrates main application views.
    *   **Changes**: Updated for routing to new authentication pages (, , , ) and wrapping the application with . Multiple UI updates for Apple-inspired design.
*   ** & **: Global CSS and Tailwind configuration.
    *   **Importance**: Define the application's visual theme.
    *   **Changes**: Extensively modified to implement futuristic and then Apple-inspired design, including custom colors, fonts, and responsive behaviors. Also added mystical glow animations and particle effects for the fal覺m branding.

</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the previous AI engineer was actively engaged in guiding the user through the manual setup of the Apple Vision Pro application using Xcode, following a complete Swift code template approach. The user was struggling with initial Xcode project setup and build errors, specifically related to  not being found and  import issues, implying that the provided environment for the AI engineer does not fully support ARKit compilation or native development.

The AI engineer's current focus is on troubleshooting these Xcode build errors step-by-step. This involves:
1.  **Verifying and correcting file target memberships**: Ensuring newly created Swift files (like ) are correctly included in the Xcode target.
2.  **Simplifying code dependencies**: Temporarily removing  imports and functionalities from  and  by replacing real ARKit logic with simulated hand tracking and simpler 3D object creation. This ensures the project builds successfully and allows the user to progress with basic UI and interaction without immediate complex hardware/SDK requirements.
3.  **Iterative guidance and verification**: Providing concise code snippets and explicit instructions for file creation, modification, and Xcode settings, then prompting the user to build and report errors for further troubleshooting.

The latest interaction confirms the file structure is generally correct, but build failures persist due to the  not being found, indicating a persistent target membership or file content issue. The AI engineer is actively breaking down the problem, simplifying the problematic components, and guiding the user to re-check fundamental Xcode settings to achieve a successful build. The last action was to provide simplified versions of , , , and  and instruct the user to clean and rebuild.
