<analysis>
The previous AI engineer successfully developed the MysticLens fortune-telling application for Apple Vision Pro, progressing from initial setup to implementing all core features and a significant UI redesign. Initially, the engineer set up the project by exploring the existing codebase, installing dependencies, and restarting services. The development then followed a modular approach, implementing each fortune-telling method sequentially.

Key milestones include the initial integration and subsequent switch from OpenAI to Gemini for coffee fortune reading, demonstrating adaptability to user preferences. The frontend was progressively built, starting with a basic UI, then a futuristic theme with multi-language support, and finally a comprehensive redesign inspired by Apple's minimalist design philosophy. Throughout the process, the engineer maintained robust backend functionality, ensuring all API endpoints were working and user data was processed, including a detailed birth chart for astrology readings. The work is currently in progress, extending the Apple-inspired design across all remaining frontend components.

<product_requirements>
The user requested an innovative spatial computing fortune-telling application named 'MysticLens' for Apple Vision Pro, leveraging emergent AI for dynamic interpretations.
Core functionalities include:
1.  **Coffee Fortune Reading**: AI analyzes coffee grounds from user photos, displaying interpretations as minimalist 3D AR objects. The AI should continuously learn from user feedback.
2.  **Palm Reading**: AI identifies and highlights palm lines on the user's virtual hand, providing interpretations.
3.  **Tarot Card Reading**: Presents a virtual tarot deck, allowing users to select cards for a three-card spread (Past, Present, Future) with concise interpretations.
4.  **Astrology Reading**: Collects birth data to generate a personalized 3D birth chart and provides horoscopes. An enhancement was requested to explicitly show the star chart for the birth day.

General application requirements: minimalist design, privacy-first data handling, intuitive UX/UI using Vision Pro's interaction paradigms (eye-tracking, hand gestures), and subtle ambient sound design.
Initial implementation saw a futuristic UI with 5-language support. The latest explicit request is a complete UI redesign to align with Apple's iconic design language: emphasizing abundant whitespace, clean layouts, premium sans-serif typography, high-quality imagery, subtle gradients, controlled color palettes, and smooth transitions. This redesign is currently being applied to all pages.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the previous AI engineer was actively engaged in a major UI overhaul of the entire application. The user explicitly requested to redesign the application's interface to align with Apple's iconic design language, focusing on minimalism, clean lines, premium typography, subtle gradients, and a calming color palette.

The engineer successfully applied these changes to the homepage and general navigation. The homepage now features a clean white background, Apple-like typography (San Francisco font family equivalent), subtle blue accent colors, and refined card designs with gentle shadows, moving away from the previously implemented futuristic neon and glassmorphism style.

The work is currently in progress of extending this Apple-inspired design to the individual fortune-telling pages. As of the last message, the engineer had just started applying these updates to the  and  components. This involves modifying their JSX structure, Tailwind CSS classes, and potentially component logic to ensure they visually conform to the new design principles established for the homepage.
